	- We have decided to split the updation of SLM into two parts. First is the "version" and second is the "edition". Currently we are updating the SLM only into "editions". Lets understand :-
	  1. **Version:** We are starting to number it from v1.0. Version updates means updation in blueprint i.e. theme, structure, formating, alignments, etc.
	  2. **Edition:** Edition means the updated law i.e. all notifications, circulars, orders etc till a cut-off date. There are 2 editions which changes every 6 months i.e. May & Nov editions. May edition includes updates of law upto 31.04.XX and Nov edition includes updates of law upto 31.10.XX.
	  
	  All changes either in "version" or "edition" would be documented and made available to be checked anytime.
